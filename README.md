## About this Project

The idea of â€‹â€‹the program is:

_"The project consists of fetching API data via PyCep"._

**PS:** We carried out the development to facilitate the search for manual zip codes on the postal service website by the user. As the user only has to upload a base in excel on Google Colab with the zip codes containing a column called CEP and then run the code to obtain the neighborhood information.

ðŸ¤©:**


## Some notes about this app

1 - We use the google colab platform to use the application

## Functionalities
